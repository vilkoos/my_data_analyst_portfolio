# Plan

To obtain my goal I plan to undertake three types of activities.

1. acquire practical skills
2. deepen/refresh theory
3. build a portfolio of projects

Time scale: the activities should be finished at the end of 2016.

-----------

## 1 - acquire practical skills

### Finish the Coursera [data science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) 
- **done**  . .The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox 
- **done** . . R Programming
- **done** . . Getting and Cleaning Data
- **done** . . Exploratory Data Analysis
- **done** . . Reproducible Research
- **done** . . Statistical Inference
- **done** . . Regression Models
- **done** . . Practical Machine Learning
- **done** . . Developing Data Products
- **done** . . Data Science Capstone

### Exploratory data analysis with inzight
Futurelearn has a statistics course centred around a very nice data exploration tool: inzight  
**done** . . do [Data to Insight](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/data-to-insight/details)

### Python for data analysis
Learn to work with Python, pandas, scipy and iPython by,  

- **done** . . work through: [Python for data analysis](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1420115197&sr=1-1&keywords=python+for+data+analysis)
- **done** . . complete [Learn to Code for Data Analysis](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learn-to-code) from the OU on FutureLearn
- **done** . . complete an equivalent of [Learning Python for Data Analysis and Visualization](https://www.udemy.com/learning-python-for-data-analysis-and-visualization/learn/#/) on Udemy.

### Finish Udacities [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002)
(start after the above is completed, todo!=do certainly, todo?=check added value before starting)
- **todo?** . . Intro to Data Science
- **todo!** . . Data Wrangling with MongoDB
- **todo?** . . Data Analysis with R
- **todo?** . . Intro to Machine Learning
- **todo!** . . Data Visualization
Done this in a non-Udacity form (MongoDB yet to finish)

## 2 - deepen/refresh theory

review of relevant theory: probability, basic distributions and Analysis of variance  
- **done** . . work trough chapter 1..14 of: [An introduction to mathematical statistics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Mathematical-Statistics-Its-Applications/dp/0321766563/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1420129515&sr=8-2&keywords=an+introduction+to+mathematical+statistics+and+its+applications)  
- **aborted** . . edX [Introduction to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-0).
- **done** . . An [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)

review of linear algebra  
**done** . . review relevant materials of [UK Open university](http://www.amazon.co.uk/University-Mathematics-Second-Course-Introduction/dp/B005DL6E24)

information theory  
**todo** . . the Coursera course [information theory](https://www.coursera.org/course/informationtheory)
