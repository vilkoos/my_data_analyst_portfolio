# The Tidy World project

Here is a nice example of what to me would be a pet-project,  
i.e. a project that: 
-  I would love to be engaged in,  
-  I'm actually working on.
-  I'm good at 

## introduction

For over 30 years I'm worrying about questions like:
- Which form of government is best? (1) (2)
- How do we compare the performance of different types of government? (4)
- How do we measure performance of government? 
- Which dimensions of government performance can we distinguish?
- How does the performance on different dimensions correlate?
- What is the "grand unifying theory of everything civil" that explains it all?  

I'm not the only one that worries.  
Many of my cherished fellows (EU, OECD, IMF, the World bank, the Economist, Gapminder, UN) collect and generously publish ample data. 

However, this universal generosity creates a problem (5).  
How do we integrate the data from these diverse sources?

It would be great if we could collect and integrate data from all these different sources in one relational database. The database will be named: the Tidy World database. With standard SQL queries we could generate a wide variety of datasets from the Tidy World database.  

## project activities

Activities needed to create the Tidy World database are:
1. design the data-model for the relational database
2. implement this model in SQLite
3. find sources of relevant data on the internet
4. for each source write scripts that grab the data from the internet an put these data into Tidy World.
5. document the data structure, and data collections
6. make a user interface to let users consult the data

Using ad-hoc SQL queries we can extract subsets of the data that are useful for particular research.   


## Notes

(1) Yes, I know, very clich√© for someone who graduated in public administration. But nevertheless, I'm genuinely fascinated by these questions. Actually, they are an important reason why I choose to study public policy in the first place.

(2) All who: 
- are interested in philosophy 
- (*much more narrowly*) are interested in ethics only
- (*even less lofty*) long to be a good citizen (3) 
- (*so petite bourgeois*) would like to get along with others.

also should worry. **Worry, very much**.

(3) Being Dutch, I would love to so substitute the English citizen by the 1789 French [citoyen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen#mediaviewer/File:Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen_in_1789.jpg). 

(4) My formative education was not public policy but electrical engineering. This question, and the next, might show background bias.

(5) No good deed will be left unpunished.
