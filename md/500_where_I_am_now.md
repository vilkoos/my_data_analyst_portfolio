## Where am I now?

Where am I now(1) on the path to being a data data scientist?  
To answers that, we first must answer questions like:  

- What is a data scientist?(7)(8) 
- Is there only one kind? 
- If there are more, which kind I want to be?

## Data science according to Conway. 

The respected data scientist [Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/) explains it all with this figure.

According to Conway data science is a harmonious mix of: statistics, computer science and subject matters expertise. To be a data scientist is to be a jack of at least these three trades(2) (for a critique see 6). 

I like this figure as a high level 'definition'.  

One reason I like it is that it makes it easy to point out where I started from. In 1986 I was awarded a masters degree(3) in what Conway labels as traditional research. To be specific, I have a master in policy evaluation and methods and techniques of social research (4). Not only am I a traditional research master, in 1986 I also had acquired considerable hacking skills (i.e. programming in Assembler, Fortran, Basic, Pascal and various database and statistical packages).  

By then, I also had found my passions: "torturing the data until they confess" and "Hacking". (the deep drives of data science according to Conway). And I must confess to be endlessly fascinated by the dark arts of choosing the "right" question to answer - and using the "right" yardstick to measure -. (5)
 
There is a second reason I like Conways definition. if I understand him correctly, I'm a data scientist since 1986.

## Data science according to O'Neil and Schutt
Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt wrote a book: [Doing data science](http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Cathy-ONeil/dp/1449358659). In chapter 1, what is data science, they visualize the relevant competencies in a figure like this.

![my competencies](http://i.imgur.com/QmS4MPY.jpg)

On the horizontal axis we see the competencies a data scientist should have. On the vertical axis my estimated competency score is displayed (where 100 = 100% of what is needed). The dark blue areas display competencies about which I'm pretty sure. The light blue areas display competencies that I have, but might be not relevant.

Some competencies clearly need work
- Data visualization. I know the basics, but I also know that there are many tools that I do not have mastered ( e.g. [data visualization](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Visualization-Dummies-Mico-Yuk/dp/1118502892/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419412617&sr=1-3&keywords=data+visualization)).
- Communication. I can write technical reports and scientific papers, however the the ambition is to write for the general public.

Some competencies need fine tuning   
(basically they are present but a refresher or specialization course would be a good idea)  
- Machine learning
- Statistics (I can do all the "tricks" but I really should have a good look at the underlying mathematical foundation)
- Programming. I have programmed in 20+ languages, but should have a very good second look at R, Python, non_SQL databases and XML.  

Some competencies are already OK.
- Databases, I'm experienced in SQL and database design.
- Mathematics, needed is linear algebra and calculus, I can do that (and much more, e.g. numerical methods).
- Domain Expertise. In a sense there can be no such thing as enough domain expertise, but within the domain I plan to tackle - public policy - I'm pretty familiar.       

According to the logic of O'Neil and Schutt I'm clearly on my way to being a data annalist. However there are some areas that still need work. 

## Data science according to Udacity

![fig3](http://i.imgur.com/I7dlLPD.jpg)

[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002) has designed a data analyst nano degree. They did so in close consultation with the relevant industry (Google, AT&T etc.). This consultation resulted in a clear insight what a [data analysis curriculum](http://blog.udacity.com/2014/12/3-paths-first-data-analyst-job.html?utm_content=buffera1ee2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=update) should contain. So, suppose you have a 18 year old fresh out of high school, which subjects and skills should you teach that youngster to make him or her a data analyst. According to Udacity that should be:

- Programming (e.g. Python and R)
- Statistics (descriptive and inferential)
- Mathematics (i.e. linear algebra, functions and calculus)
- Machine learning (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning)
- Data wrangling (e.g. SQL, non-sql, XML, regular expressions)
- Data visualization 
- Data intuition (a somewhat vague mix of subject matter expertise and project experience).  

Udacities findings agree well with those of O'Neil and Schutt. So, using Udacities curriculum as a reference, I again conclude that I'm well on my way to being a data annalist. However there are some areas that still need work. The detailed curriculum of Udacity specify the areas to work on. 

Comparable information can be found elsewhere, e.g.:

## What kind of data scientist? 
We can conclude that data science is a very broad field. This field can be partitioned in several ways.  

One way to partition would be after domain of expertise. In my case that would be public policy.

An other way would be to partition by used techniques. Basically I need techniques to:
- collect data from the internet, 
- wrangle the data,
- do the analysis,
- publish on  the internet.

There is in all likelihood no need for techniques for [Big Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) (i.e. parallel processing massive and distributed data sets).    

So in terms of Conway I want to be a "traditional" policy researcher with "small" data hacking skills.  
I think I'm well on my way to that goal (70 to 90% of the competencies already are in place).   
But there is clearly still some work to do.

## Notes
(1) now at the time of writing is November 2014.  

(2) alternative definitions like: 
- a data scientist is someone how knows more about statistics than any computer scientist, and more about computer science than any statistician
- a data scientist is a statistician who lives in the San Francisco area

are true, but there is more to it than just that (although the second definition beautifully captures the deep truths that it the whole business is seriously over-hyped and that there is very little to it that is really new)  

(3) strictly speaking I never got a masters. I got, what in Dutch is called, a doctoral degree (I'm not a MA or a Msc but a Drs. - actually a Drs.ing) NB, a doctoral degree is not a doctors degree; it translates as doctor-to-be, all I have to do is to write a dissertation and then I loose the 's' and be a Dr. In 1988 the EU switched to the Anglo Saxon bachelor/master system, the Dutch Drs. became defunct and was replaced by the masters title (and I could add; the length of the program I did was reduced by one year, so Drs = Msc + 1, or for C style programmers Drs = Msc++). Whatever you think about these innovations, one thing is sure. I can proudly claim to be a certified "old Dutch Master".  

(4) Some might be unimpressed by the claim to be a social "scientist". Those who are not impressed probably associate social with: vague, political and partisan. The unimpressed are right in the sense that is indeed what many sociologist are. However, these critics in their conventional correctness - like lady Thatcher - tend to miss the crucial point: there is such a thing as society. So there can exist a science that studies it. To deny that is, scientifically speaking, as bad as to deny evolution or global warming. The unimpressed are also right in the sense that, to be scientifically sound, while doing sociology, is damn difficult.

(5) I'm a well trained policy analyst, i.e. you can give me any set of policy relevant data and I can construct a scientific narrative that supports the policy that the officeholders in their infinite wisdom already had chosen. Conversely, you can give me any scientific report that the opposition would like to use. Using the same data it is almost always possible to reach different conclusions. The miraculous thing is that you can do this without deceiving or cheating. The trick is to ask the data the "right" question and to choose the "right" yardsticks to measure. 

(6) Some people do not belief that there is such a thing as a master of all these three trades. The set of people that are AND statisticians AND can program AND are subject matter experts is empty, no such people exist, only [unicorns live at that intersection](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/am-i-a-data-scientist/).   
For others Conway is too permissive, perfect data scientist also should have good communication skills, see [the perfect Venn diagram](http://ranalytics.vn/en/2016/04/28/the-data-scientist-venn-diagram/)     

(7) Gill Press has written an informative article about the academic origins of the term data science: [A Very Short History Of Data Science](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/)

(8) Lee Baker has written a [blog](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blog/show?id=6448529%3ABlogPost%3A439088) that all aspiring data-scientists should read. On the first sight he just discusses the question if statistics is obsolete because we have data-science now. He says wise things about the value of statistics (statistics is about quantifying [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty)). . . . But he becomes really valuable when he proceeds with a "definition" of what data-science does: 

> Data Science is all about extracting knowledge from data 

To do the extracting you have to know a lot about computer science and mathematics. 
But to know what counts as knowledge - first and above all else - you have to have subject matter expertise.  
Hence, subject matter knowledge like Business, Medicine or Engineering is the biggest skill a data scientist should have.
