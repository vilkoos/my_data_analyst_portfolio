# Completed Open On-line Courses

**Note** 
Below "soa" means statement of accomplishment  
A soa is a .pdf Coursera sends when a student -identified by login only- has fulfilled all course requirements.  
A verified certificate is the same, but with identity checking by web-cam and typing pattern.  
**PS1:** FutureLearn and edX also have soa's but they are called certificates.  
**PS2:** As of 2016, Coursera no longer hands out free soa's, neither do FL and edX.
