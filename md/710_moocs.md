# Completed Open On-line Courses

**Note** 
Below "soa" means statement of accomplishment 
A soa is a .pdf Coursera sends when a student -identified by login only- has fulfilled all requirements of a course.  
A verified certificate is the same, but with identity checking by web-cam and typing pattern.
