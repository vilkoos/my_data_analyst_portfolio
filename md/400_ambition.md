In the spring of 2016 I will retire as a lecturer.  
The plan is to fill retirement with daring and fun activities.

### ambition
Inspired by [guerilla gardeners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_gardening), it is my ambition to become the worlds first **guerilla data annalist** (1).    
(i.e. use the tools of data science to surprise the powers that be.)

What I mean by guerilla data analysis is:   
1 - identify a "hot" societal discussion,  
2 - collect all the relevant data that can be found on the internet,  
3 - clean and merge the data,  
4 - do the data analysis,  
5 - report in a form that is appropriate to the intended readers.  

The only thing radical about this is that I intent to be uncompromisingly scientific and truthful.  
(I can afford to be, I'm retired, so I'm beyond material gain or a craving for academic status.)

**PS** 
My identification with captain Wilard is not unbounded.  
I do not plan to infiltrate behind enemy lines to strategically assassinate evil masterminds.
