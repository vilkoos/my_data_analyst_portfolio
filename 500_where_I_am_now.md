Where am I now(1) on the path to being a data data scientist?

To answers that, we first must answer questions like:  

- What is a data scientist? 
- Is there only one kind? 
- If there are more, which kind I want to be?

## Data science according to Conway. 

The respected data scientist [Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/) explains it all with this figure.

According to Conway data science is a harmonious mix of: statistics, computer science and subject matters expertise. To be a data scientist is to be a jack of at least these three trades(2). 

I like this figure as a high level 'definition'.  

One reason I like it is that it makes it easy to point out where I started from. In 1986 I was awarded a masters degree(3) in what Conway labels as traditional research. To be specific, I have a master in policy evaluation and methods and techniques of sociological research (4). Not only am I a traditional research master, in 1986 I also had acquired considerable hacking skills (i.e. programming in Assembler, Fortran, Basic, Pascal and various database and statistical packages).  

Furthermore, I also found my passions: "torturing data until they confess" and "Hacking"  
(the deep drives of data science according to Conway).   
 
There is a second reason I like Conways definition. if I understand him correctly, I'm a data scientist since 1986.






## Notes
(1) now at the time of writing is November 2014.  

(2) alternative definitions like: 
- a data scientist is someone how knows more about statistics than any computer scientist, and more about computer science than any statistician
- a data scientist is a statistician who lives in the San Francisco area

are true, but there is more to it than just that (although the second definition beautifully captures the deep truths that it the whole business is seriously over-hyped and that there is very little to it that is really new)  

(3) strictly speaking I never got a masters. I got, what in Dutch is called, a doctoral degree (I'm not a MA or a Msc but a Drs. - actually a Drs.ing., but that is an other story -) *NB, a doctoral degree is not a doctors degree; it translates as doctor-to-be, all I have to do is to write a dissertation and then I loose the 's' and be a Dr.* In 1988 the EU switched to the Anglo Saxon bachelor/master system, the Dutch Drs. became defunct and was replaced by the masters title (and I could add; the length of the program I did was reduced be one year, so Drs = Msc + 1). Whatever you think about these innovations, one thing is sure. I can proudly claim to be a certified "old Dutch Master".  

(4) Some might be unimpressed by the claim to be a social "scientist". Those who are not impressed probably associate social with: vague, political and partisan. The unimpressed are right in the sense that is indeed what most sociologist actually are. However, these critics in their conventional correctness - like lady Thatcher - completely miss the crucial point. There is such a thing as society. To deny it is, scientifically speaking, worse than to doubt evolution or global warming. The unimpressed are also right in the fact that, to be scientifically sound, while doing sociology, is damn difficult.
