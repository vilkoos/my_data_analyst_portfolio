**NOTES**

(1) As a lecturer/engineer/social scientist/critical thinker, I can't help but wonder: 
- did the educational innovators -finally- get it right?
- are portfolios the next big thing in education?
- if so, what is a a good portfolio, how do you do it?

 My way of answering these questions: try, fail, next time fail better.
