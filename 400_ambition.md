In the summer of 2016 I will retire as a lecturer (comp.sci. & bus.admin.).  
The plan is to fill retirement with daring and fun activities.

### ambition
It is my ambition to become the worlds first **guerilla data annalist**.    
(i.e. use the tools of data science to surprise the powers that be.)

What I mean by guerilla data analysis is:   
1 - identify a relevant societal discussion,  
2 - collect all the relevant data that can be found on the internet,  
3 - clean and merge the data,  
4 - do the data analysis,  
5 - report in a form that is appropriate for the intended reader.  

The only thing radical about this is that I intent to be uncompromisingly scientific and truthful.  
I can afford to be, I'm retired, so I'm beyond material gain or a craving for academic status.  

**Corollary**: Retirement is the new -true- tenure.

**PS 1** 
My identification with captain Wilard is not unbounded. I'm not considering infiltration behind enemy lines to strategically assassinate evil masterminds.  

**PS 2**
If you have exciting data analysis projects do not be scared by my Wilard persona, please contact me.
Examples of exciting projects are:
- data wrangling /cleaning /collecting (this is my idea of fun) 
- brainstorm about the possibility to exploit "big data" for the flourishing of your organisation
- in-house statistics/ data analysis/ business intelligence training
