In the summer of 2016 I will retire as a lecturer (comp.sci. & bus.admin.).  
The plan is to fill retirement with daring and fun activities.

### ambition
It is my ambition to become the worlds first **guerilla data annalist**.    
(i.e. use the tools of data science to surprise the powers that be.)

#### also for hire (see note 1)

If you have exciting data analysis projects, please let me know; e.g.:
- data wrangling /cleaning /collecting (this is my idea of fun) 
- brainstorm about the possibility to exploit "big data" for the flourishing of your organisation
- in-house statistics/ data analysis/ business intelligence training 

**NOTE** 
[1] although I will mainly work for fun, it is not my intention to spoil the market.  
So, hiring me definitely will involve fun, but it is not dirt cheap.
