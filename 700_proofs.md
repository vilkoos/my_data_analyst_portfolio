## Data wrangling

Some examples of data wrangling exercises I did

- Comparing the impact of weather events in the nineties and noughties, [Rpub](http://rpubs.com/vilkoos/52188)     
Assignment 2 of the November 2014 Coursera course [Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata)   


- Merging data on six Excel sheets into a .csv file and documenting the result in a code book.  
See the github repository [CTWdata](https://github.com/vilkoos/CTWdata)
